<h3> Implementation of different artificial inteligence algorithms (Spring 2013) </h3>

Algorithms covered:
<ul>
  <li>Hill climbing to solve nQueens problem</li>
  <li>Simulated annealing to solve nQueens problem</li>
  <li>Decision Tree - ID3 to give probability of goal in socker.</li>
  <li>Neural network to classify written digits</li>
</ul>

All algorithms are implemented in C# from scratch without using any existing libraries. <br/>
Programs are developed in Slovenian language as part of Artificial Inteligence class in spring 2013.
